- **Ask AI Chat:** A simulated AI chatbot offering insightful, keyword-driven responses related to business, money, study techniques, relationships, and personal development.
- **Summarize Notes:** A note-taking assistant that extracts key points and generates concise summaries from user input text using smart JavaScript algorithms.
- **Generate Smart Tasks:** A goal-oriented task generator producing actionable, editable steps based on user-defined objectives such as launching a business or starting a YouTube channel.
- **Daily Motivational Quotes:** A dynamic quote generator that inspires users with uplifting messages to maintain momentum and focus.
