Build a fully responsive, mobile-first, single-page web app called "NaijaSmart – AI Productivity Suite for Nigerians" using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No backend or API calls; all logic must run in the browser.

Features:

1. Landing Page:
  - Title: "NaijaSmart – All-in-One AI Assistant for Smart Nigerians"
  - Subtitle: "Work smarter. Study better. Hustle sharper."
  - Four large, clean, animated buttons to navigate to:
    - Ask AI Chat
    - Summarize Notes
    - Generate Smart Tasks
    - Daily Quote

2. Ask AI Chat:
  - Input box and Send button
  - Show a loader animation ("AI is thinking...") before responding
  - Implement smart GPT-style chatbot logic using JavaScript string methods like .toLowerCase() and .includes() for keyword detection with fuzzy matching.
  - Responses should include Nigerian-themed advice for keywords like "business", "money", "study", "relationship", "motivation", and fallback message: "Interesting! Try rephrasing your question."
  - Add typing animation for the bot response using setTimeout to simulate real-time typing.
  - Store full chat history in localStorage with timestamps.
  - Provide buttons to download chat history as a .txt file and to clear chat history.

3. Summarize Notes:
  - Large textarea for pasting or typing notes
  - "Summarize" button triggers JS logic that extracts main points and keywords (simulate AI summarization using string manipulation and simple heuristics).
  - Provide Copy to Clipboard and Download as .txt functionality.
  - Save last summary to localStorage.

4. Generate Smart Tasks:
  - Input for user to enter a goal or project (e.g., "start a YouTube channel")
  - JS logic returns 5–7 actionable tasks based on keyword templates for "business", "study", "hustle", "personal growth".
  - Tasks are editable inline by the user.
  - Include loading and typing animations before displaying tasks.
  - Save tasks to localStorage.
  - Export tasks as .txt file.

5. Daily Motivational Quotes:
  - Button cycles through 10–15 motivational Nigerian-themed quotes with emojis.
  - Add Copy to Clipboard and Share to Twitter buttons.
  - Style with subtle animated background or emoji icons.

6. Dark Mode toggle with sun/moon icon:
  - Save user preference in localStorage and apply on page load.

7. Responsive Navigation:
  - Sticky top navbar or floating bottom tab with icons/text to switch between the four main tools.
  - Use JavaScript to show/hide tool sections without reloading the page.

8. Design & UX:
  - Clean, modern UI using CSS Flexbox/Grid.
  - Naija-inspired color palette: green, white, gold/yellow.
  - Smooth animations for buttons, loaders, and transitions.
  - Mobile-first responsive layout.

9. Footer:
  - Text: "Built by Abdulrahman Adisa Amuda for #3MTT Showcase"
  - Use 3MTT branding colors or icon if possible.

10. Code structure:
  - Write in separate files: index.html, style.css, script.js
  - Use semantic HTML, well-commented CSS and JS.
  - Fully offline-capable; no external dependencies.
  - Prepare for easy deployment on GitHub Pages or Replit.

Additional chatbot logic example to implement in script.js:

```js
function getAIResponse(input) {
  const q = input.toLowerCase();
  if (q.includes("start a business")) {
    return "Start small: register with CAC, learn your market, and use WhatsApp or Instagram to reach customers.";
  }
  if (q.includes("how to make money") || q.includes("make money")) {
    return "Consider freelancing, digital services, mini-importation, or small trading using your skills.";
  }
  if (q.includes("study tips") || q.includes("school tips")) {
    return "Try the Pomodoro technique: study 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break.";
  }
  if (q.includes("relationship advice")) {
    return "Communicate openly, respect boundaries, and support each other's growth.";
  }
  if (q.includes("motivation") || q.includes("lazy")) {
    return "Discipline beats motivation. Set small daily goals and celebrate your progress.";
  }
  if (q.includes("ai tools")) {
    return "Explore free tools like ChatGPT, Canva, and NaijaSmart to boost productivity.";
  }
  return "Interesting! Try rephrasing your question or ask about business, study, money, or relationships.";
}
